# Project Summary:
The project involved developing an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which analyzes text records of items purchased throughout the day. The program aimed to assist the store in rearranging its produce section by providing insights into the frequency of items purchased. It offered functionalities such as finding the frequency of a specific word, listing frequencies of all items, and generating a histogram representing item frequencies.

# What I did well:
I believe I executed the modular design of the code effectively, breaking down functionalities into separate classes to promote clarity and maintainability. Additionally, I ensured that the code adhered to industry-standard best practices, including proper naming conventions, in-line comments for readability, and input validation for user interactions.

# Areas for enhancement:
One area where the code could be enhanced is implementing more robust error handling and input validation mechanisms. This would make the program more resilient to unexpected user inputs or file errors, thereby enhancing its security and reliability. Additonally, incorporating unit tests could further validate the functionality of individual components and catch potential bugs early in the development process.

# Challenging pieces of the code:
One challenging aspect was designing the histogram generation functionality to accurately represent item frequencies in a visibly appealing format. To overcome this, I researched various methods for displaying histograms and experimented with different approaches until finding one that balanced simplicity and clarity. Additionally, I leveraged online resources and documentation to deepen my understanding of C++ features and standard library usage.

# Transferable skills:
This project enhanced my skills in object-oriented design, file handling, and user interface development, which are widely applicable across various programming projects. Additionally, it improved my problem-solving abilities, as I had to devise efficient algorithms for counting word frequencies and generating histograms. These skills will undoubtedly prove valuable in future coursework and real-world software development scenarios.

# Maintainability, readability, and adaptability:
To ensure maintainability, I followed best practices such as modular design, proper documentation, and adherence to coding standards. By encapsulating functionalities within separate classes and providing clear interfaces, the codebase remains organized and easily adaptable to future changes or additions. Moreover, in-line comments were strategically placed to explain complex logic or clarify the purpose of specific code segments, enhancing readability for myself and other developers who may work on the project in the future.
